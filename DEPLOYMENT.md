# Deployment Guide

This document explains how to deploy the Simple Todo app to GitHub Pages (Web) and GitHub Releases (Android APK).

## Overview

The app uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment:

- **Web Version**: Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`
- **Android APK**: Built on every push to `main` and available as a workflow artifact

## GitHub Pages Setup (Required for Web Deployment)

To enable GitHub Pages for your repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Blank-Vulture/Simple-Todo
2. Click on **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Source**: GitHub Actions
5. Save the settings

After the next workflow run, your web app will be available at:
**https://blank-vulture.github.io/Simple-Todo/**

## Accessing the Deployments

### Web Version
- **URL**: https://blank-vulture.github.io/Simple-Todo/
- **Deployment**: Automatic on every push to `main`
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/web-deploy.yml`

### Android APK
- **Location**: Go to the **Actions** tab → Select the latest **Build Android APK** workflow run → Download the `app-debug` artifact
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`

> **Note**: The APK is currently a Debug build. For production releases with signing, additional keystore configuration is required.

## Workflow Status

You can check the status of your deployments:
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
- Select the workflow you want to inspect
- View logs and download artifacts

## Manual Deployment Trigger

You can manually trigger the Android build:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Build Android APK** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select the `main` branch
5. Click **Run workflow**

## Troubleshooting

### Web Deployment Fails
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the `web-deploy.yml` workflow ran successfully in Actions tab
- Ensure the `dist` folder is being generated by Expo

### Android Build Fails
- Check Java version (should be 17)
- Verify Node.js version (should be 20)
- Review error logs in the Actions tab

## Next Steps

### For Production Android Release:
1. Generate a keystore file
2. Add keystore secrets to GitHub repository secrets
3. Update `android-release.yml` to use `assembleRelease` instead of `assembleDebug`
4. Configure signing in `android/app/build.gradle`

### For Automated Releases:
1. Create a Git tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`
2. The APK will be automatically attached to the GitHub Release
